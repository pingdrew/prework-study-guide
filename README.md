# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description
Project created for the Coders Bootcamp Pre-Work

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation creating this project was stemming from my desire to learn more languages, with an emphasis on HTML.
- I built this project because creating something like this is a major milestone in my journey learning with coding.
- This project helps me study more and add more things to study while simultaniously forcing me to remember key concepts due to it being a website I created.
- Everything about HTML including the head and body, linking java and css to HTML and making visual changes with css. I have learned so much about visual studio and using github and git bash to create files and branches as well.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Simply review the notes added in each section that was covered during the pre-work. If you need help deciding what to study, look at the console for a randomly chosen topic for you to pick.

## Credits

All credits go to the UT prework website which gave me step by step instructions on how to complete this project.


## Tests

one simple test to see that the randomly chosen topic is truly random and covers every topic is to sit in the console and refresh the page until you see every topic at least once.
